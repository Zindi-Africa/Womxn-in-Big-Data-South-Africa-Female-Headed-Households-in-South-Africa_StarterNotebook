[**Womxn in Big Data South Africa: Female-Headed Households in South Africa**](https://zindi.africa/competitions/womxn-in-big-data-south-africa-female-headed-households-in-south-africa/data)

Female household headship has been on the rise in South Africa in recent years. Compared to male-headed households, female-headed households tend to face greater social and economic challenges. Female-headed households, in general, are more vulnerable to lower household incomes and higher rates of poverty.

The South African census collects data on female headship and income levels of every household across the country every 10 years. However, it is important for policymakers and other actors to have accurate estimates of these statistics even in between census years. This challenge explores how machine learning can help improve monitoring key indicators at a ward level in between census years.

The *objective of this challenge* is to build a predictive model that accurately estimates the % of households per ward that are female-headed and living below a particular income threshold by using data points that can be collected through other means without an intensive household survey like the census.

This solution can potentially reduce the cost and improve the accuracy of monitoring key population indicators such as female household headship and income level in between census years. The winning solutions will be made publicly available at the end of the competition.
